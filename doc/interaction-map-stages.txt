GEOMETRY
────────
z   → zig‑zag (alternate deltas)
g   → hopper ray
h   → locust ray
y   → second‑leap geometry (after capture)

ANNOTATION
──────────
(no modifiers act here)

PATH FILTERING
──────────────
p   → stop at first non‑empty (clear path)
o   → remove empties before first capture
x   → remove enemy squares
c   → remove empty squares
m   → remove enemy squares

CAPTURE LOGIC
─────────────
o   → must capture first
x   → must not capture first
c   → capture only
m   → move only
y   → must capture first (to trigger leap)
g   → capture on landing
h   → capture on hurdle

CONTINUATION
────────────
t   → continue sliding after capture
u   → ignore blockers (continue past enemy/friendly)
y   → continuation is a leap, not a slide
g   → no continuation
h   → no continuation

LANDING RULES
─────────────
o   → landing must be capture
x   → landing must be empty
c   → landing must be enemy
m   → landing must be empty
y   → landing must obey move/capture rules
g   → landing must obey move/capture rules
h   → landing is always capture
